# DaAA: Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms & Analysis

## Overview

This project implements classic divide-and-conquer algorithms with safe recursion patterns and collects detailed metrics for empirical analysis. The algorithms include MergeSort, QuickSort, Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians), and Closest Pair of Points in 2D. The codebase is structured for clean experimentation, benchmarking, and reporting.
